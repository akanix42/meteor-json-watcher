# JSON Watcher for Meteor

This plugin watches your .json files so that Meteor reloads when you make changes to them.
It doesn't do any processing to your .json files, just enables the auto-reload.

## Installation

Install using Meteor's package management system:

```bash
meteor add nathantreid:json-watcher
```
